          <h3><a name="what-is-overflow" class="anchor" href="#what-is-overflow"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is overflow?</h3>
          <p>Right now, <em>overflow</em> is an idea. I'm planning to water it, but for now <em>overflow</em> is <a href="http://www.crimson.net.nz/">just me</a>.</p>
          <h3>The idea</h3>
          <p>overflow is a way of living - an acknowledgement that we can't give what we don't have, that we are better when we work to our strengths and that we shouldn't hurt ourselves to help others.</p>
          <p>overflow is about blessing others because of the blessings we have received. It's about wanting to give because we are able, through the support we receive from God and the people around us.</p>
          <h3><a name="more-to-come" class="anchor" href="#more-to-come"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The overflow manifesto</h3>
          <p>The first thing I want to develop is a manifesto, similar to the <a href="https://www.holstee.com/pages/manifesto">Holstee manifesto</a>. This manifesto will capture this thinking into an easily understandable and displayable format so it can be shared and agreed with.</p>
          <h3>Supportive community</h3>
          <p>For this idea to really take off, it needs a community of people behind it - sharing, encouraging and supporting each other.</p>
          <p>The best way to live in overflow is to have a supportive community that intentionally overflows to each other. In this environment everyone will be giving what they can and receiving what they need. I want to see this community grow in New Zealand.</p>
          <h3>Outward focussed teams</h3>
          <p>As we receive overflow we will give our excess away to people in the community who need it. Are you good at making websites, cooking meals or just listening over coffee? You can bless someone else with your talents and we want you to be part of this community. We will group you with others who can help with the work or support you in other ways.</p>
          <p>When we give we will also receive. We can look at what we've done and know we're making the world a better place.</p> 
          <h3>How this started</h3>
          <p>In 2014 I volunteered overseas for 7 months. I was working hard and great things happened, but I wasn't in a healthy place for myself and I burnt out. When I returned to New Zealand I did a lot of thinking and identified my lack of overflow as one of the issues. Coming back to a full time job and knowing I'd committed to help organisations in the USA and Thailand I decided something had to change so I didn't repeat my mistakes.</p>
          <p>I learned a lot too - the importance of communication, the strength of a unified community and the power of a small gesture. Right now this is an idea, but you can help it become a reality!</p>
